# Linear-Regression-and-Misconceptions-Srrounding-It
This repository contains explanation and scripts supporting to understand the OLS method of calculating coefficients and intercept. Also it clears and proves some misconceptions about implementing OLS.
In this repository, weâ€™ll delve into the core concepts of OLS, its computational process for optimizing coefficients and intercepts, misconceptions around OLS and provide a sample example for a clearer understanding.

It is purely focused on two big misconceptions to clear them and the facts to prove.

## Misconceptions:
1) Linear Regression (OLS) uses gradient descent algorithm to optimize the weights and intercept.

2) Feature Scaling will improve the results and performance metrics of the model.

## Facts:
1) Feature contributions that drive your target value will be same in both cases- scaled and non-scaled.

2) Interpretation of the scores of linear regressions (OLS) where response (target) variable is scaled, can mislead you.

Linear Regression Notebook contains instructions and explanation on each part of the script, follow them to understand the concepts.
